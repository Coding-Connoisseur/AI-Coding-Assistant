# AI Coding Assistant 🤖💻

The **AI Coding Assistant** is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to assist developers by automating various stages of the software development lifecycle. Leveraging cutting-edge models like OpenAI’s GPT-3/Codex, this assistant helps software engineers, developers, and data scientists generate, refactor, test, and improve code with natural language inputs. The assistant can integrate seamlessly with popular IDEs, command-line tools, and version control systems to streamline development workflows.

## Key Features 🚀

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLP)**: 
  - Understands user input in natural language and translates it into code-related tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and testing.
  
- **Code Generation**:
  - Generates code in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java) based on user descriptions.
  - Supports generation of specific functions or full code blocks tailored to the user’s request.

- **Code Refactoring**:
  - Automatically refactors existing code to improve readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
  - Provides suggestions for code optimization and best practices.

- **Code Testing**:
  - Executes code snippets and provides detailed feedback on the output, errors, or any exceptions that occur.
  
- **Autonomous Code Improvement**:
  - Analyzes and suggests improvements to code structure and efficiency, including recommendations for optimizing algorithms and data structures.
  - Provides complexity analysis and performance enhancement tips.

- **Seamless IDE and CLI Integration**:
  - Integrated with popular IDEs such as VSCode and PyCharm, allowing in-editor interactions with the assistant.
  - Fully functional CLI for running commands, generating code, refactoring, and more.
  
- **Version Control System Integration**:
  - Integrated with Git, supporting operations like committing changes, creating branches, and pushing to remote repositories.
  
- **API Access for Extensibility**:
  - Exposes RESTful API endpoints for generating, refactoring, and testing code, allowing for integration with external tools and services.

## How It Works ⚙️

- The AI assistant processes natural language instructions to generate, refactor, or test code.
- It integrates with OpenAI’s GPT models (GPT-3, Codex) to understand user intent and provide intelligent code outputs.
- Developers can interact with the assistant through a **RESTful API**, **command-line interface (CLI)**, or directly within **IDEs**.

## Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- OpenAI API Key (for accessing GPT-3/Codex models)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-coding-assistant.git
   cd ai-coding-assistant
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/MacOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Ensure you have an OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   ```

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   ```

### Running the AI Assistant

#### 1. Run as an API:
```bash
python main.py
```
The API will start at `http://localhost:5000/`.

#### 2. Use the CLI:
```bash
python main.py cli
```

## Example API Usage 📡

### Generate Python Code
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate_code \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"description": "Create a Python function that adds two numbers", "language": "python"}'
```

### Refactor Code
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refactor_code \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"code": "def add(a, b): return a + b"}'
```
