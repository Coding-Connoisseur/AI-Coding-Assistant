# AI Assistant - Setup Guide

Welcome to the AI Assistant setup guide. This document will walk you through the steps required to install, configure, and run the AI Assistant on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
- OpenAI API key (if you are using OpenAI models like GPT-3/Codex)
- Git (for version control integration)

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the AI Assistant repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-coding-assistant.git
cd ai-coding-assistant
2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# On Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Use the requirements.txt file to install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Environment Variables
You will need an OpenAI API key to use GPT-3/Codex models. Set your API key as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
5. Running the AI Assistant
To run the AI Assistant, simply execute the main.py file:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will start the assistant and make it available for CLI or API interaction.

6. Logs and Debugging
Logs are generated in the data/logs/ai_assistant.log file. You can monitor model operations, errors, and performance metrics from this log file.

7. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with dependencies, ensure that you're using the correct version of Python (3.8 or higher).
Check your OpenAI API key and ensure it’s correctly set in your environment.
If the assistant fails to generate code or process input, verify that the API calls are being made successfully by checking the logs in data/logs/ai_assistant.log.

## Endpoints

### 1. Generate Code

Generates code based on a description.

- **URL**: `/generate_code`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
    "description": "Create a Python function that adds two numbers",
    "language": "python"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "code": "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b"
}
2. Refactor Code
Refactors the provided code to improve readability and performance.

URL: /refactor_code
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "code": "def foo():\n    print('hello world')"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "refactored_code": "def foo():\n    print('Hello, World!')"
}
3. Test Code
Runs the provided code and returns the output or any errors.

URL: /test_code
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "code": "def test_func():\n    return 42"
}
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "output": "42"
}
Error Handling
If there is an issue with your request, you will receive an error response:

Status Code: 400 Bad Request
Response:
json
Copy code
{
    "error": "Invalid input provided"
}
Example Usage
To generate Python code using the API:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate_code -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Write a Python function to multiply two numbers", "language": "python"}'
To refactor code using the API:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refactor_code -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "def hello():\n    print(\"hello\")"}'
Purpose: This API reference document provides information on how to interact with the AI assistant's endpoints, making it easier for developers to integrate with the assistant.
