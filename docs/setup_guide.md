# AI Assistant - Setup Guide

Welcome to the AI Assistant setup guide. This document will walk you through the steps required to install, configure, and run the AI Assistant on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
- OpenAI API key (if you are using OpenAI models like GPT-3/Codex)
- Git (for version control integration)

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the AI Assistant repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-coding-assistant.git
cd ai-coding-assistant
```

## 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional)

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
# On Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

You will need an OpenAI API key to use GPT-3/Codex models. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

For Windows:

```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

## 5. Running the AI Assistant

To run the AI Assistant, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the assistant and make it available for CLI or API interaction.

## 6. Logs and Debugging

Logs are generated in the `data/logs/ai_assistant.log` file. You can monitor model operations, errors, and performance metrics from this log file.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you're using the correct version of Python (3.8 or higher).
- Check your OpenAI API key and ensure itâ€™s correctly set in your environment.
- If the assistant fails to generate code or process input, verify that the API calls are being made successfully by checking the logs in `data/logs/ai_assistant.log`.

# AI Assistant - API Reference

This document describes the available APIs for interacting with the AI Assistant. The API allows you to generate code, refactor code, and more via HTTP requests.

## Base URL

The AI assistant API runs on the following base URL:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

## Endpoints

### 1. Generate Code

Generates code based on a description.

- **URL**: `/generate_code`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
    "description": "Create a Python function that adds two numbers",
    "language": "python"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
    "code": "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b"
}
```

### 2. Refactor Code

Refactors the provided code to improve readability and performance.

- **URL**: `/refactor_code`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
    "code": "def foo():\n    print('hello world')"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
    "refactored_code": "def foo():\n    print('Hello, World!')"
}
```

### 3. Test Code

Runs the provided code and returns the output or any errors.

- **URL**: `/test_code`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
    "code": "def test_func():\n    return 42"
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
    "output": "42"
}
```

### Error Handling

If there is an issue with your request, you will receive an error response:

- **Status Code**: `400 Bad Request`
- **Response**:

```json
{
    "error": "Invalid input provided"
}
```

## Example Usage

To generate Python code using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate_code -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Write a Python function to multiply two numbers", "language": "python"}'
```

To refactor code using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/refactor_code -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "def hello():\n    print(\"hello\")"}'
```
